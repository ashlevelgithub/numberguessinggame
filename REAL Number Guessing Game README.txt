Number Guessing Game ReadMe File 


The program starts by importing the random library, with a defined numerical integer range of 1-10 

The program then states the rules of the game in question and asks if the user wants to play the game
- If user complies, the game continues 
- If the user says no, then the program quits with the quit command 
 
The program then asks for input from the user between the numbers of 1-10

The program then goes through 4 different conditions using the "if" operator 
- If the number is guessed correctly, the user gets a congratulatory message 
- If the number is under the guess range, the user is given a sarcastic message saying the guess was too low 
- If the number is over the guess range, the user is given a sarcastic message saying the guess was too high 
- Else if any another input is given that is not an integer between 1-10, the program displays a discouraging message, and quits the program using the quit command
